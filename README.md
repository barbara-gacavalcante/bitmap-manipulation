# bitmap-manipulation


"Bitmap Manipulation" was a project in Assembly, completed by BÃ¡rbara and Ana as part of their Computer Architecture course. The program takes in a BMP image and the parameters of a rectangular area in pixels that needs to be censored. The output is a new BMP image with the specified area censored.
